# Data Mining and Predictive Modeling in Python

This repository contains two data science projects that apply supervised and unsupervised machine learning techniques to real-world datasets using Python. These notebooks demonstrate practical approaches for customer segmentation, model evaluation, and exploratory data analysis.

## Projects Overview

### 1. Insurance Customer Segmentation (`InsuranceAnalysis.ipynb`)
A full data mining pipeline to segment insurance customers using classification models and clustering techniques.

#### Key Tasks:
- **Data Cleaning**: Missing value treatment, outlier detection, and duplicate removal
- **Feature Engineering**: Correlation analysis and dimensionality reduction
- **Supervised Learning**: Trained and evaluated Decision Tree, KNN, and SVC models
- **Unsupervised Learning**: Applied K-Means clustering with elbow method and t-SNE visualization
- **Insights**: Identified the most important features influencing customer groups

#### Highlights:
- Achieved **98% accuracy** with Decision Tree classifier
- Clustered customers into **5 natural segments** using unsupervised learning
- Visualization of feature importance, ROC curves, and cluster distributions

### 2. Exploratory Python Analysis (`PythonAnalysis.ipynb`)
A supplementary analysis notebook showcasing data preprocessing, visual analytics, and model experimentation.

#### Key Tasks:
- Exploratory data analysis and plotting
- Testing machine learning models on new features
- Practice with feature transformation, scaling, and encoding
- Enhanced understanding of classifier performance under different data configurations
